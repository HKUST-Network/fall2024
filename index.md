ELEC 3120 is an introductory course in computer networks. The emphasis will be on the basic performance and engineering tradeoffs in the design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes one project requiring significant design and implementation and spanning the whole semester.

The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include: congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming, multi-casting, switching, internetworking, and network security. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, the project, one midterm exam, and one final exam.

For potential students, please read the announcement below before you decide to add this course.

### **NEW!!** 

As you might have noticed, the quota for ELEC3120 is doubled from the past semesters. This is because ELEC3120 will only be offered in the Fall semester from now on and will not be available in Spring 2025. Please plan your course schedules accordingly to accommodate this change. 

### Am I suitable for this course?

ELEC 3120 is full of fun -- you will learn how the Internet works, how to build a network, and how to secure it.
Now when I look back, I can see that the computer network is full of clever yet simple ideas, and I want to convey these ideas to you.
We also have a series of project checkpoints to help you to get your hands dirty by building a simple file transfer application. 
This is also one of the few courses offered by ELEC that helps you to improve your coding skills -- you will learn to use Git, Copilot, and other tools that are widely used when you're going to find a job in software-related fields.

Here is a way to see if you are suitable for the coding skills in ELEC 3120.
Forget about the exams in COMP 2011 -- ELEC 3120 is not going to test your coding skills on papers. 
Just think about the programming assignments: do you like it? do you enjoy writing code? If you quite enjoy it (and probably are even taking COMP 2012), then ELEC 3120 will be easy for you. If you (at least) do not suffer from it, ELEC 3120 is still a good choice.
However, if you feel that writing and debugging code is a nightmare, then you may want to reconsider your choice.

### What project am I going to do?

You will implement a TCP socket yourself in C++.
Don't be scared. You will only required to implement the core part of TCP with the minimum engineering efforts. 
This is a semester-long project with four checkpoints, and we will guide you through the whole process.

Why so?
Because we want you to understand how the most important protocol on the Internet, TCP, works, and the best way to understand it is to implement it yourself.
And also, for many ELEC students, this will be the only programming project in your undergraduate study. For future engineers, it is important to know how to make plans for a project.

## Prerequisites

* COMP 1021 (Python Programming)
* COMP 2011 (C++ Programming) -- This is not a hard requirement, but it is strongly recommended.

If you believe you are capable of the knowledge of C++ programming but do not satisfy the prerequisites, send me an email and I will waive your prerequisites.
